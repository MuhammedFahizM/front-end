    <h1>Sousuke Aizen</h1>
    <p>Sousuke Aizen (藍染 惣右介, Aizen Sousuke)[note 1] is the former captain of the 5th Division of the Gotei 13, whose
        lieutenant was Momo Hinamori; before his captaincy, Aizen served as the division's lieutenant under Shinji
        Hirako.
        For over a century, Aizen masqueraded as a benevolent Shinigami officer while secretly plotting his betrayal and
        conducting depraved experiments, which around 100 years ago led to the Hollowfication of the Visored and their
        (alongside Kisuke Urahara's) forced exile. Aizen's plans reach a tipping point after he slaughters the Central
        46, orchestrates Rukia Kuchiki's execution, and fakes his own death in a successful ploy to obtain Urahara's
        Hōgyoku. After retrieving said artifact and revealing his treachery, Aizen and his longtime followers, Gin
        Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, retreat from Soul Society into Hueco Mundo, where Aizen is revealed to have built an
        army of Arrancar.</p>
